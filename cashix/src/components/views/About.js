        <h1 className="About_paragraph">CRED is also equipped with the CRED protect feature which is an AI backed system that keeps track of every single nuance of a credit card payment journey - right from due date reminders, spend patterns and other card usage statistics. Additionally, when a member makes a credit card payment through the app, they are eligible to a variety of rewards of various forms such as access to events, experiences, gift cards and upgrades from brands like Diesel, Cure.Fit, Myntra, Olive Bar & Kitchen among many more. How to apply for a CRED membership? Since CRED is only for a select few, you can apply for a membership by signing up with your full name and a valid Indian mobile number on the app. Once your credit score is checked from credit bureaus like CIBIL, Experian and CRIF, and your score falls above the accepted eligibility score, you will be accepted as a member of CRED. Once you become a member, you will be able to access the curated set of exclusive rewards and privileges that are offered by CRED.</h1>
